# chat-roomies
A nodeJs chat application built with socket.io<br />
<br />
Users join by providing a username and a room name. If the room was not already present, that room will be created and other users can join the same room by the name of the room.<br/>
<br />
Users can have same usernames but not in the same room.<br />

Issues :
  1. Slow loading of the chat page initially.
  2. When two tabs in the same window are open then the app crashes. The problem does not persist if two seperate windows are used.
